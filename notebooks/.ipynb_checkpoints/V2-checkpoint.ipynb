Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.\\n\\nAmazon Web Services, or other cloud providers\\nIZEA\\'s software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazon’s EMR would also be an asset.\\n\\nContinuous Integration & Deployment\\nIZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible.

We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow.\\n\\nPrimary Responsibilities\\n\\nYou will...\\nWork with stakeholders to define the solutions to development problems and business requirements\\nDevelop and maintain the features and capabilities of our data ingestion pipelines\\nExtract actionable and impactful insights from vast amounts of data\\nDevelop and maintain the services that surface those insights and make them available for consumption in a performant manner\\nCreate unit and integration tests for your code\\nReproduce and fix bugs reported by internal and external users\\nSet goals and communicate often about your progress toward them\\nContribute to the ongoing improvement of the engineering organization and our software\\n\\nWhat We’re Looking For\\n\\nA problem solver at heart\\nMuch of our work revolves around problems that have no existing off-the-shelf solution or consensus on best practices. You\\'ll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.\\n\\n3+ years of engineering experience\\nThings move quickly in the data group. You’ll need to be comfortable and familiar with delivering highly scalable cloud based applications.\\n\\nProfessional experience with frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or similar\\nThis will be a significant component of your responsibilities.

This is part of what Agile means to us.\\n\\nExcellent verbal and written communications skills\\nRegular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.\\n\\nDemonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued\\n\\nData Science Background\\nWhile not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. Practical experience with Machine Learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.\\n\\nFront End development experience\\nFrom time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. Familiarity with modern web frameworks like Angular, React, Ember, or Vue would be helpful. Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.\\n\\nAmazon Web Services, or other cloud providers\\nIZEA\\'s software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazon’s EMR would also be an asset.\\n\\nContinuous Integration & Deployment\\nIZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible.
